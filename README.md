numcxx - a collection of python compatible classes for linear algebra in C++ {#mainpage}

## Rationale

- Provide  lightweight  multidimensional  linear algebra  classes  for
  C++11

- Keep the  code reasonably  simple and  transparent for  beginners in
  order to be useful for teaching

- Study expressive capabilities of modern C++ in the context of numerical
  algorithms

- Zero copy,  reference  counted exchange  of  array  data with  other
  packages without copying data, in particular
  - LAPACK
  - UMFPACK
  - triangle

- interface to python/numpy (work in progress)


Many  ideas  used behind  this  library  have  been developed  in  the
framework of  the WIAS  [pdelib](http://pdelib.org) project,  and they
evolved over many  years.  C++11 allows for  a standard-conforming and
concise implementation, and so this code is as well a concept study.

Anyone  expecting a more  sophisticated package  may have  a look  at these
projects:

- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
- [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)
- [Blaze](https://bitbucket.org/blaze-lib/blaze/overview)
- [Trilinos/DOMI](https://trilinos.org/packages/domi)
