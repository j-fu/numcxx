This  directory contains  a number  of basic  examples for  simple C++
programs.  Furthermore, we  describe different  possibilities to  work
with vectors/arrays in C++.

They build independently  of the numcxx tree.
Each of the example can be built and executed
using the commands

$ g++ -o example example.cxx
$ ./example

Alternatively, the g++ can be replacd here by numcxx-build:


$ numcxx-build-o example example.cxx
$ ./example
