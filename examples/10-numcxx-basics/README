This directory  contains a number  of basic examples  introducing the
numcxx library.

They  build independently  of the  numcxx  tree but  use an  installed
version of numcxx.

In order to  compile these examples, use cmake  and the CMakeLists.txt
file in this directory.

Alternatively, they can be built by numcxx-build:

$
$ numcxx-build -o example example.cxx
$ ./example
$
